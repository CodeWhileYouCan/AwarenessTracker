# AwarenessTracker
This is a basic PHP project that allows a user to track some essential daily stats, all relating to life-quality. The default information to be tracked in this system is as follows.
1.	How many hours spent doing creative work?
2.	A quality score for the day (+2, +1, 0, -1, -2)
3.	A note of what happened that day
Given the date range, a user can search historical data for insights. 

Features:
•	Users can register to the system by providing basic user data such as name, email, contact and password. 
•	AWS RDS service is used to create the online database instance and MYSQL workbench is used as the client.

Setup instructions
•	No special setup is required to run the program.  However, it is required to have an environment prepared for the PHP development. The following link provides you all the instructions for the PHP environment setup.   https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/php/quickstart.html
